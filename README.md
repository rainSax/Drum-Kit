### Built with

- javascript

### What I learned

- use of javascript switch case statements
- javascript functions and function callbacks
- use of setTimeout to create a delay
- creating and playing an Audio element

### Continued development

For continued development I would like to make the website responsive and create different views for mobile as well as tablet.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) - This site helped me understand how to create a delay in addition and removal of drum animation when clicked.
